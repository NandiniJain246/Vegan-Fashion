    Members are amazing
</h1>
<h2>
    For over 75 years, our members have helped make veganism what it is today; a thriving lifestyle choice for everyone.  
</h2>
<h2>
    Over the past year the support of our members has helped us to host events in every sitting parliament in the UK, conduct pioneering <span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">research</span> into what leads people to veganism and the vegan <span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">consumer and business market</span>, and help many thousands of people try a vegan diet. With the support of members we were also able to hold our Grow Green conference, launch The Vegan Society’s <span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">International Rights Network</span> , create our app<span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">VeGuide</span>  and increase the number of trusted vegan products on the market to over 45,000. We had our campaign, Catering for Everyone, publicly backed by 25 elected politicians. We have created our own Podcast, <span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">IThe Vegan Pod</span>, and launched <span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">Future Normal</span> , our biggest campaign to date.
</h2>  
<h1 style="color: teal;">
    Why offer a <span style="color: coral;"><u><a href="youth.html" target="_blank">Youth Membership</a></u></span>?
</h1>
<h2>
    We want to encourage young people to be part of the generation to question our use of other animals and to do things differently, to create a more compassionate world.
    <br>
    Lauren Williams, Membership Marketing Consultant for The Vegan Society, said:
</h2>


<h2 style="background-color:gainsboro; text-align: justify;"> <i>
    "We are so excited to launch our Youth Membership category. Veganism is a diverse and fast-growing movement, and we need everyone on board to help support and bring about positive change. To continue growth within the vegan movement, increased awareness of The Vegan Society’s work is essential.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our members help us to create a more compassionate world by supporting our campaigns, education work, advocacy and outreach.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Youth Membership is not only accessible financially but unlocks access to resources that will provide inspiration and guidance for young people on the vegan way of life. Wherever you are on your vegan journey, The Vegan Society is here to help.”
</i>
</h2>
<h2>
    Membership of The Vegan Society is also open to non-vegans who support the society’s work but are not yet vegan.  
</h2>
<h1 style="color: teal; text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">
    Why now?
</h1>
<h2>
    Many young people agree that now is the time to be amplifying young voices in the vegan movement. The threat from the climate crisis means that young people are the most likely to be affected by the impacts of animal agriculture on our planet. Decisions and policy being made now could lead to a brighter future for the next generation. 
</h2>
<h1 style="color: teal; text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">
    What are the benefits of joining as a Youth Member? 
</h1>
<h2>
    Like full membership, signing up for <span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">Youth Membership</span> means you will get access to 10% off our multivitamin, VEG 1, and over 130 third party discounts such as, 10% off One Planet Pizza, 15% off Munchy Seeds and 15% off Nourish London skincare. Our discounts are there to help with every aspect of living a vegan lifestyle, from clothing to wear, cosmetics to use and even places to go on holiday.
    <br>
    As part of being a member you will also get a subscription to the eco version of  <span style="color: coral;font-weight: bold;">The Vegan magazine</span>. This is published every quarter and features essential updates on all of our recent work as well as interviews with influential vegans, recipes, competitions, advice, shopping and more.
